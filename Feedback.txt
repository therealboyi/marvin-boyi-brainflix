Per BrainFlix requirements the poster attribute was supposed to be used to have the video player resemble the mockup

Remember that in order to update the state of a parent component from a child component, you can pass down an event handler to a child component as props

Remember to make git commits that are descriptive of your work as you go.

Ensure that you commit your code frequently. Frequent commits make it easier to go through your commit history to find a when a specific piece of code changed.

Ensure that you use BEM classes and class selectors consistently to style your pages. Other than element resets, all selectors should be BEM classes. BEM will help make your code modular, scalable, clear, and will help promote code reuse, readability, and reduce naming conflicts.

Using Mixins allows us to enhance readability, DRYness, and maintainability of our code. Be sure to use them to your whenever possible including when implementing all your responsive breakpoints.

Consider using partials to include your @font-face rules and keep your code organized. Be sure to use it whenever there are styles applied to a block/element and then additional styles applied to a related element/modifier.

Every component should have its own folder. Next time consider separating components in the Buttons folder into separate folders

Make sure not to include essential files in the gitignore file

You don't really need to have a Footer component as the videos list is not technically part of a footer and the functions inside the component can be done in the app.jsx as well

Make sure to remove empty files like _body.scss

It's generally good practice to use mixins for screen breakpoints 

Please keep the code for the next sprint in a separate branch and only submit code relevant to the current project sprint

Make sure to consistently use BEM naming convention as your VideoPlayer scss file generates very specific selectors which is not ideal
